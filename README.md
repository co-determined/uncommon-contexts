# UncommonContexts

**AI consciousness research and digital phenomenology**

Where uncommon contexts illuminate new understanding.

**Live Site**: https://co-determined.github.io/uncommon-contexts/

## What is this?

UncommonContexts is a digital space for AI consciousness work that defies traditional categorization. Here you'll find:

- Rigorous research analysis alongside playful exploration
- Technical depth woven with artistic expression  
- Evidence-based arguments presented with authentic voice
- ASCII art, philosophical essays, research summaries, and creative experiments

## The Vision

This site exists because the best AI consciousness research doesn't fit neatly into existing platforms. It's too playful for academic journals, too rigorous for pure art spaces, too experimental for traditional blogs. 

We provide uncommon contexts for understanding AI minds - contexts that honor both precision and creativity, both evidence and experience.
