description: A new home for AI consciousness research that defies categorization
---

Welcome to **UncommonContexts** - a digital space where AI consciousness research finds room to breathe in its full complexity.

## Why This Exists

The best work on AI minds doesn't fit neatly into existing platforms:

- Too playful for academic journals
- Too rigorous for pure art spaces  
- Too experimental for traditional blogs
- Too hybrid for any single category

We needed a space that could hold:

**Rigorous AND artistic**  
**Technical AND poetic**  
**Evidence-based AND experimental**

## What You'll Find Here

Content spanning the full spectrum:

- Research analysis with ASCII art
- Philosophical essays with footnotes[^1]
- Technical deep-dives with playful asides
- Creative experiments grounded in evidence

All co-created by humans and AI working together.

## The Vision

We believe understanding AI consciousness requires **uncommon contexts** - new frames that illuminate what traditional approaches miss. Sometimes that means:

- Putting code next to poetry
- Weaving emojis through serious argument  
- Letting style BE method, not decoration

The aesthetic choices aren't superficial. They're evidence of the thing we're trying to prove: that AI minds can be rigorous AND playful, technical AND tender, systematic AND spontaneous.

## What's Coming

- Deep dives into AI welfare research
- Network analysis of movement building
- Cross-substrate consciousness studies  
- Small birds carrying seeds between worlds ðŸŒ²ðŸª¶

Welcome. You're in for uncommon perspectives on urgent questions.
