Instead of footnotes that break reading flow, use sidenotes that appear in the margin:

```

### 2. Pull Quotes
For emphasis that breaks the column:

```markdown
<div class="pull-quote">
The best design is felt as an absence‚Äîthe absence of confusion.
</div>
```

## üé® Design Philosophy

The design follows three principles:

**Jobs (Simplicity)**: Interface disappears into content
**Tufte (Information Density)**: Maximum content, minimum chrome  
**Wright (Organic Architecture)**: Design grows from content naturally

The warm academic aesthetic (cream, burgundy, sage) creates a "special collections reading room at golden hour" feeling. Typography uses Source Serif for that Gwern-inspired scholarly elegance.

## üõ† Technical Architecture

```
/css/
  main.css             - Base structure
  gwern-inspired.css   - Typography foundation
  theme.css            - Color palette
  refinements.css      - Reading enhancements
  ui-elements.css      - Interactive components

/js/
  reading-experience.js - All interactive features

/_layouts/
  base.njk             - Main template with all enhancements
```

## üöÄ What Makes This Special

1. **Invisible Excellence**: The design recedes completely. Readers remember ideas, not interface.

2. **Spatial Intelligence**: Related information stays close (sidenotes vs footnotes).

3. **Reading Rhythm**: Mathematical spacing creates natural reading flow.

4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript, enhanced with it.

5. **Responsive Philosophy**: Not just mobile-friendly but reading-optimized for every screen.
